# Dlab-FinalProject-PickachuVolleyball
• Created a streamlined Pikachu Volleyball game in Verilog on the Vivado platform, featuring classic gameplay and new
enhancements like skins and spike shots.

• Implemented on an Arty development board with a connected display, the game utilizes SRAM for efficient image
conversion and a finite state machine for smooth gameplay mechanics, offering a fresh twist on a nostalgic experience.
